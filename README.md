# CAPSTONE-REACT

I will be rebuilding my Capstone project using React in this project. I will make some changes if necessary. 

I will use the same API so only a frontend will be necessary for this project.

I will also be using the exact same dependencies and functionalities; the only difference is that it will be done in React. 

I plan to start on this project as soon as possible as I have just started learning it so I am eager to see how far I will get.
